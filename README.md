# QA Testing Portfolio
This repository is a demonstration of my software testing skills. Since I do not have commercial experience yet (except for freelance work), I created this portfolio to showcase my abilities in various testing areas. The tests and cases in this portfolio aim to reflect my knowledge and experience in functional, API, and non-functional testing.

Repository Structure. 
This repository is divided into three main folders, each corresponding to a different type of testing:
1. Functional Testing - Contains test cases related to the functionality of software applications, ensuring that they behave as expected.
2. API Testing - Includes test cases for verifying the functionality, performance and security of APIs.
3. Non-Functional Testing - Focuses on testing non-functional aspects such as accessibility, performance, and usability.

Tools Used
1. Google Sheets - Used to document and organize test cases for manual testing.
2. Postman - Used ro API testing.
3. WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) - Used for accessibility testing.
